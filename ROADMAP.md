## Exercise 4: Multi-Step Form Wizard 🧙‍♂️

**Difficulty**: Advanced
**Time**: 90+ minutes

### Requirements

Create a multi-step form using routing:

#### Steps:

1. **Personal Info** (`/signup/personal`)
   - Name, email, phone
2. **Account Details** (`/signup/account`)
   - Username, password
3. **Preferences** (`/signup/preferences`)
   - Newsletter, notifications
4. **Review** (`/signup/review`)
   - Show all entered data
   - Confirm and submit

#### Technical Requirements:

- ✅ Each step is a separate route
- ✅ Use layout route for the wizard container
- ✅ Progress indicator showing current step
- ✅ "Next" and "Previous" navigation
- ✅ Store form data in state (we'll learn better methods later)
- ✅ Validate before moving to next step

### Challenge

The tricky part is maintaining form state across route changes! Here are some approaches:

**Approach 1: Context** (Recommended for now)

```typescript
// Create a context to store form data
// We'll learn better patterns in later modules
```

**Approach 2: URL State**

```typescript
// Store data in search params
// Limited to serializable data
```

### Hints

    ├── _layout.tsx      # Wizard layout with progress
    ├── personal.tsx     # Step 1
    ├── account.tsx      # Step 2
    ├── preferences.tsx  # Step 3
    └── review.tsx       # Step 4
```

</details>

### Bonus Challenges 🌟

- Add form validation with Zod
- Prevent navigation to future steps
- Save progress to localStorage
- Add animations between steps
- Create a "save draft" feature
